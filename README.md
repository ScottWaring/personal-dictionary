This is an Angular app that allows the user to search for words using the WordsApi, save those results to their own personal library, and create a definition in the users own words for an word they have saved to their library.

To use the app you'll need your own api key - you can get it at: https://www.wordsapi.com/

When you have the api key paste it into line 75 of word.service.ts where it says Api Key.

Please let me know if you have any questions.
